name: 'Capsule for Holistic Causal Learning with Causal Graphs: A Credible Method
  for Study Design and Preregistration in the Social Sciences'
description: While research designs in the social sciences have employed increasingly
  sophisticated methods to control false positive rates, there is still substantial
  debate about the merit of pre-registration and other recent open science reforms.
  In this paper, I present a method for preregistering causal graphs and employing
  the metric of entropy, and in particular Jaynes' theory of maximum entropy, to propose
  a holistic way of measuring the contribution of a research study. To demonstrate
  the method's utility, I show how recent research in both COVID-19 and political
  authoritarianism can be fruitfully understood using causal graphs and entropy. Additionally,
  I provide R code to enable researchers to compute these metrics, helping them prepare
  for various outcomes and learning approaches for the purpose of preregistration.
